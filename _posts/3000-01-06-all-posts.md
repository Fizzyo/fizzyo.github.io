## 19th June 2019

We can measure every single breath, of every single treatment, of every single day, while playing a game. It's a miracle that data is pouring in, the likes of which we've never seen before. 
Eleanor Main: Professor of Physiotherapy, University College London

Project Fizzyo is changing the way that physiotherapy is done for children with Cystic Fibrosis. Eleanor Main, Professor of Physiotherapy at University College London says, ‚ÄúWe can measure every single breath, of every single treatment, of every single day, while playing a game. It's a miracle that data is pouring in, the likes of which we've never seen before.‚Äù

Data is analysed in Microsoft Azure, where data scientists apply machine learning and artificial intelligence to create highly focused advice for individual patients. Cian‚Äôs father is delighted with the project, concluding, ‚ÄúIt's really about motivation, making Cian see all the good things outside CF, and I think it makes life a little easier.‚Äù [read more about the project and Cian here](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-US/story/731791-fizzyo)

Back in 2017, Simon Jackson joined the Fizzyo project working in specifically on the Gaming Framework

The aim of the project was to simply ask the following question:

What physiotherapy treatments do children and young people with cystic fibrosis actually use, and is the frequency of doing them related to health outcomes?

It might sound odd, but it‚Äôs not actually known if the prescribed treatment is wholly beneficial, or if regular exercise and medication is a better path. It should be, based on current evidence, but it‚Äôs not been scientifically proven.

The Fizzyo Project‚Äôs goals

Cystic Fibrosis causes a build-up of thick sticky mucus in the lungs, digestive system and other organs, causing a wide range of challenging symptoms affecting the entire body.

The Fizzyo project was created to focus on the breathing exercise treatment a patient undergoes to clear the mucus from their lungs, where they blow long and hard into an airway clearance device in repeated sessions for upwards of 20 to 30 minutes at a time, several times a day. As you can imagine, for any individual this would be very boring. For a child, however, this would seem like an eternity.

For research, the project wants to capture data and feedback to validate the effectiveness of the treatment, finally proving or disproving the effects. Or, better yet, identify ways to improve the exercises and tailor them to each patient for the best effectiveness.

As a secondary effect, we wanted to make these time consuming and sometimes painful exercises more fun, encouraging kids to do them through gaming.

The Fizzyo Framework

From breath to game to analytics
Sensor Inputs

The framework takes input from a custom input module attached to an airway clearance device that vibrates the air as a patient blows through it (attempting to loosen any mucus in their lungs). This module has two inputs:

A pressure sensor to capture how strong/long the patient is blowing
A single button to drive interaction
Paired with the sensor is a FitBit, to also track the patient's pulse and other health data but this isn‚Äôt available to the games at this time.

Project Fizzyo: improving physiotherapy care for children with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) at Microsoft [Future Decoded](https://www.futuredecoded.com/session/f8b708f0-ddca-e811-bce7-000d3a22322e) Download the [presentation](https://storageprdv2inwink.blob.core.windows.net/8db60c15-c71b-4512-a6eb-74b389f494bf/37234826-0650-48c7-b127-e02639de510c)

Project Fizzyo is about using technology to transform physiotherapy healthcare for children with Cystic Fibrosis (CF).  It is also about the extraordinary things that happen when experts across different industries collaborate. Lung clearance techniques and exercise can slow down the progression of CF lung disease, but these routine physiotherapy treatments are boring and burdensome. Families find it really hard to adhere to the full prescription. For Project Fizzyo, we worked with engineers and computer scientists from Microsoft, UCL and Great Ormond Street Hospital to build electronic chips for airway clearance devices and a secure and sustainable data transfer platform. We also designed computer games that are played by breathing through the chipped airway clearance device, to try and make the treatments less boring and more enjoyable.   Using these innovative big data and machine learning methods, we can start to understand how sticking to prescribed treatments can improve clinical outcomes. In this session we will walk you through the project and talk about the outcomes, as well as discussing how in the future this kind of work has the potential to radically change the way we deliver and evaluate the effects of medical interventions like physiotherapy and may facilitate personalised and evolving care plans as children grow and change with life circumstances.

Project Fizzyo Announced as Winner of AbilityNet Tech4Good Award 2017 - Digital Health Award
Both of Vicky Coxhead‚Äôs sons have Cystic Fibrosis and because of this they have to do regular physio to keep infections at bay. She applied to feature on a a new BBC2 documentary asking for families with a problems to get in touchand was introduced to Haiyan Zhang, who volunteered to help. Haiyan works as Innovation Director at Microsoft Research in Cambridge. She enlisted the help of Creative Technologist Greg Saul to create a device that could take the boys‚Äô breaths and turn them into controls for a videogame. Together, with Lee Stott at Microsoft UK, they organised hackathons where volunteer designers and engineers from across the UK came along to make new video game experiences for the Coxhead boys.
