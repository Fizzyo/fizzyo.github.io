Project Fizzyo: improving physiotherapy care for children with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) at Microsoft [Future Decoded](https://www.futuredecoded.com/session/f8b708f0-ddca-e811-bce7-000d3a22322e)
Download the [presentation](https://storageprdv2inwink.blob.core.windows.net/8db60c15-c71b-4512-a6eb-74b389f494bf/37234826-0650-48c7-b127-e02639de510c)

Project Fizzyo is about using technology to transform physiotherapy healthcare for children with Cystic Fibrosis (CF).  It is also about the extraordinary things that happen when experts across different industries collaborate.
 
Lung clearance techniques and exercise can slow down the progression of CF lung disease, but these routine physiotherapy treatments are boring and burdensome. Families find it really hard to adhere to the full prescription. For Project Fizzyo, we worked with engineers and computer scientists from Microsoft, UCL and Great Ormond Street Hospital to build electronic chips for airway clearance devices and a secure and sustainable data transfer platform. We also designed computer games that are played by breathing through the chipped airway clearance device, to try and make the treatments less boring and more enjoyable.   Using these innovative big data and machine learning methods, we can start to understand how sticking to prescribed treatments can improve clinical outcomes.
 
In this session we will walk you through the project and talk about the outcomes, as well as discussing how in the future this kind of work has the potential to radically change the way we deliver and evaluate the effects of medical interventions like physiotherapy and may facilitate personalised and evolving care plans as children grow and change with life circumstances.

Project Fizzyo Announced as Winner of AbilityNet Tech4Good Award 2017 - Digital Health Award
Both of Vicky Coxhead’s sons have Cystic Fibrosis and because of this they have to do regular physio to keep infections at bay. She applied to feature on a a new BBC2 documentary asking for families with a problems to get in touchand was introduced to Haiyan Zhang, who volunteered to help. Haiyan works as Innovation Director at Microsoft Research in Cambridge. She enlisted the help of Creative Technologist Greg Saul to create a device that could take the boys’ breaths and turn them into controls for a videogame. Together, with Lee Stott at Microsoft UK, they organised hackathons where volunteer designers and engineers from across the UK came along to make new video game experiences for the Coxhead boys.
