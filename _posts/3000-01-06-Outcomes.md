Innovative big data analysis methods will be used to address the primary research questions below:

<li>            What is the proportionate impact of adherence with prescribed ACTs and exercise on clinical outcomes in children with CF?</li> 
<li>         What is the specific impact of feedback or gaming technology during ACTs and exercise on adherence over time and the impact of this adherence on clinical outcomes?</li>
<li>          Which particular ACT technique is associated with the best clinical outcomes in children with CF, aged 6-16 years? (and at what ages or stages of disease are different ACTs most effective)</li> 
<li>          What is the minimum effective dose of ACTs, physical activity or exercise and the proportionate benefits of each to sustain optimal lung function and exercise capacity, and reduce hospital admissions?</li>
<li>            Can any improvements in adherence to ACTs from feedback or computer gaming be sustained over long periods of time?
<li>            Can remote monitoring and big data analysis help identify sensitive composite outcome measures for children with mild signs and symptoms.</li>
