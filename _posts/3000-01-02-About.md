                Cystic Fibrosis is a chronic, life-limiting condition affecting sufferers from birth. Approximately 1 in 2500 babies are born with CF.<br>
With improved prevention and treatment life expectancy for patients has slowly increased and currently stands at an average of 41 years of age.

Project Fizzyo is about trying to improve physiotherapy care for children with Cystic Fibrosis. 
Airway clearance techniques (ACTs), physical activity and exercise can mitigate the progression of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) lung disease, but routine physiotherapy treatments are burdensome and adherence is low. Traditional research methods (RCTs) have failed to produce credible evidence to guide practice, partly because ‘blinding’ isn’t possible and patient preference can confound results.

We have worked with engineers and designers and UCL computer science students through the Industry Exchange Network (IXN) to develop electronically chipped ACT devices and wearable activity trackers to facilitate automatic data transmission from the homes of children with CF to the clinicians and researchers caring for them. Industry partners (Microsoft) and UCL computer science experts and students have also helped us develop computer games driven by breathing through an ACT device (to enhance treatment enjoyment and adherence).

The project will use this technology for passive remote capture and transmission of longitudinal data during ACTs, physical activity and exercise daily in 160 children over 18 months. A data scientist will use this data, reconciled with individual demographic and longitudinal clinical records, to identify positive and negative clinical outcome predictors.  Computer gaming will be introduced and removed (interrupted time series design) to evaluate the effect of gaming on ACT adherence and clinical outcomes during the study.

Innovative big data analysis methods will be used to address the primary research questions below:<br>
<li>            What is the proportionate impact of adherence with prescribed ACTs and exercise on clinical outcomes in children with CF?</li> 
<li>         What is the specific impact of feedback or gaming technology during ACTs and exercise on adherence over time and the impact of this adherence on clinical outcomes?</li>
<li>          Which particular ACT technique is associated with the best clinical outcomes in children with CF, aged 6-16 years? (and at what ages or stages of disease are different ACTs most effective)</li> 
<li>          What is the minimum effective dose of ACTs, physical activity or exercise and the proportionate benefits of each to sustain optimal lung function and exercise capacity, and reduce hospital admissions?</li>
<li>            Can any improvements in adherence to ACTs from feedback or computer gaming be sustained over long periods of time?
<li>            Can remote monitoring and big data analysis help identify sensitive composite outcome measures for children with mild signs and symptoms.</li> 
<br>

This exciting remote monitoring platform has the potential in future to guide personalised physiotherapy prescription based on individual treatment responses, generate accurate, sustainable population-based physiotherapy registry data, and provide a template for remote monitoring of other interventions in CF across the NHS.

                The Fizzyo device is a wireless sensor that connects to existing CF Physiotherapy equipment, turning breaths into controls for video games.<br>
