Check out [Repos](#all-posts) for links to the main Fizzyo Repo and information to help you with your Fizzyo hack. 

Innovative big data analysis methods will be used to address the primary research questions below:

What is the proportionate impact of adherence with prescribed ACTs and exercise on clinical outcomes in children with CF?
What is the specific impact of feedback or gaming technology during ACTs and exercise on adherence over time and the impact of this adherence on clinical outcomes?
Which particular ACT technique is associated with the best clinical outcomes in children with CF, aged 6-16 years? (and at what ages or stages of disease are different ACTs most effective)
What is the minimum effective dose of ACTs, physical activity or exercise and the proportionate benefits of each to sustain optimal lung function and exercise capacity, and reduce hospital admissions?
Can any improvements in adherence to ACTs from feedback or computer gaming be sustained over long periods of time? 
Can remote monitoring and big data analysis help identify sensitive composite outcome measures for children with mild signs and symptoms.
